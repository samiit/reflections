What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-> A new .git folder is created which contains meta-data about the status of the files in the repo. All commits if made would be tracked. Only after initializing a repo, we can add commits to it; make changes and track them!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-> Staging area contains the most recent committed files in the repo.

When added from the working directory, it hosts the files from the working directory that need to be committed to the repo.
All changes we make in a file have to be added first to the staging area; otherwise, they won't be committed. Staging area hence contains the changes to be tracked in a given working directory before committing them to the repo.

It is the dynamic space where changes get hosted. We may not wish all files/changes from the working directory to be tracked in the first place. Therefore, the staging area gives more efficiency.
